    <h2>About Ungluates</h2>
    <p>This page is dedicated to the various kinds of ungulates. Most ungulates (but not all) are hoofed animals. This includes cattle, deer, goats, and more. Ungulates can be further broken down into the odd-toed (Perissodactyla) and even-toed (Artiodactyla) ungulates.</p>
    <p>Perissodactyla, or the odd-toed ungulates, as the name suggests, tend to have an odd number of weight-bearing toes. Two or four of the usual five toes are either vestigial, or not present at all, leaving either three toes, or only a single one. Examples of Perissodactyla include horses, rhinos, and tapirs</p>
    <p>Even-toed ungulates, on the other hand, usually bear weight on two of the five toes. Examples of Artiodactyla include cattle, bison, giraffes, and, strangely enough, whales.</p>
